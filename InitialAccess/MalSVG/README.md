# Malicious SVG

JavaScript code can be embedded in SVG files.  
Once you open `evil.svg` by double clicking, a browser will open and the embedded JavaScript code will be executed, then redirect to arbitrary website.  
See the code of `evil.svg` file for details.  

This technique is used for phishing or other campaigns.
