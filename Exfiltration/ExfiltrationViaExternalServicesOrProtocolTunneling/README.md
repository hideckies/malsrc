# Exfiltration Via External Services or Protocol Tunneling

Online platforms are also used for exfiltrating data instead of an attacker-owned C2 server for preventing detection.  
The following platforms are often used for this purpose:

- [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/)
- Discord
- GitHub
- [localhost.run](https://localhost.run/)
- [LocalXpose](https://localxpose.io/)
- [MediaFire](https://www.mediafire.com/)
- [Mega](https://mega.io/)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)
- [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/)
- Slack
